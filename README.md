Awesome developer experience (DX)

### Blogs

- [The HelloSign API](http://blog.hellosign.com/the-rise-of-developer-experience/) - Good blog post taking into account factors in building a good API DX.
- [developerexperience.org](http://developerexperience.org/) - Out of date Tumblr and not updated, but has some gems.

### Not Awesome

_But still useful for framing the question:_ What is good DX?

- [Heroku DX](https://www.heroku.com/dx) - Page outlining some DX questions, but really just showing three products that are useful to people already invested in Heroku. 

> "With Heroku DX, weâ€™re introducing three new developer experience features that provide better control surfaces, deeper performance insights, easier database management, and a powerful one-click method for configuration and deployment."

This isn't necessarily DX. Where is the line between users and developers, between cogs in a machine and actual stakeholders? Going to have to think about this.
